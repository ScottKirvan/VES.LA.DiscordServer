# goals
- create a way for members to communicate, socialize, and network together, and for them to be able to reach out to their board members
- increase membership engagement and extend public education and outreach
- support VES membership as a global organization, creating a space where industry nomadic members can network, stay in touch, and benefit from being a member of VES. 
- create a welcoming community where we can mentor non-members and introduce them to VES
- create a spot to showcase what VES offers members
- create new tools to help out members out, like an industry specific job-board
- create options to in-person events, which are currently reaching only a small portion of our membership.
- also... community presentations, gatherings, etc.

- Supporting nomadic members means we have to cross section boundaries.  
- Supporting public outreach means we should have public sections.  
- For a job board to be effective for our membership, we have to make it available to non-members alike.  If a member is looking for a job, they're not looking for a VES owned business, so hirers need the ability to post jobs.  Likewise, VES members hire talent, and limiting their ability to reach an audience of talent is counterproductive.  

### overview and issues with existing system
- issues I'm seeing
	- flat permissions system with no verification or follow-up
	- permissions managed per channel (unmanageable)
	- a ton of unused channels 
	- membership vetting isn't happening (unmanageable, so the server is effectivly public)

### high level overview of proposed changes
- define a required tiered permission system 
	- minimally staff-members-grays
- rework permissions handling so it's largely per category rather than per channel
- remove unused channels
- categorize topics into more general topics 
	- prepro - post - on-set - vp - vfx - games
- change permission so most channels are public
- create members-only channels, including section channels that members can subscribe into.
- bots:  add news feeds?  starboards? jobbot?
	- bot for active members verification and permissions management (custom, bespoke)
		- just drop in a support ticket bot like I have in ves-wa as a stop-gap
	- job board bot (manny @ unreal-slackers - custom) 
	- news feed and starboard bot

### About Member's Only Sections
There is almost nothing that happens among membership that couldn't be public facing.  The members-only events we do already require registration with valid email, VES numbers, tickets, etc.  Any discussion or promotion of those events will only benefit us as an organization by making it clear that there are member's only events.  All of these events are typically published on public calendars anyway, so I don't see a need for heavy handed use of members-only sections -- instead, we lean into a more open, public discord server where all sections and the public can participate, with limited numbers of members-only sections.  More members-only sections can be added in a more ad-hoc way at any time.

Something that is members-only might be things leading up to the awards, but I think even awards discussions among the general membership are verboten and wouldn't be allowed in an official, members-only channel.  So again, a limited number of members-only sections should suffice and will greatly reduce administration and moderation workloads.

In terms of the BOMs, having them separate is really just nice for the members so they can avoid the noise and confusion of seeing how the sausage is made.  BOMs are encouraged to collaborate already, so I think giving the BOM sections separate channels, but keeping the permissions open between them all would of great value.  There's nothing legitimate happening in one BOM section that should be hidden from another, and watching how one BOM handles certain things can be of huge value to another BOM that's struggling with anything similar.

### details of select changes
- make a decision on which channels are public and which are members only?


## brainstorm:


### questions for pfist
- where is manny running
	- cost?
	- github sponsor - how is this working?
	- discuss setting up one for ves - I think it would be ideal for a similar jobboard.
	- would you help?
	- why 2 bots?
	- suggested resources?
- slackers/dpx
	- is it funded? if so, what kind of budget?
	- is there any backstop in place for continuity in case you don't run it someday?
	- what's the permissions orginization? inherited per category? inherited per chan?  how are the levels or perms handled?
